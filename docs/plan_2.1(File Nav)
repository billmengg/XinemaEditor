MVP Step 1: File Navigator / Clip Browser (Tabbed UI)

UI Layout:

* Tabbed interface: Each main component has its own tab.

  * Tab 1: File Navigator / Clip Browser (current focus)
  * Tab 2: Timeline / Workspace (future)
  * Tab 3: Script / Audio Input (future)
  * Tab 4: Output / Export (future)

File Navigator Tab Components:

1. Folder Navigation Panel

   * Left-side vertical panel showing folder hierarchy.
   * Browse local directories (e.g., Video Footage 2).
   * Expand character folders to show clips.
   * Optional: remember last opened folder.

2. Clip List / Grid Panel

   * Main area displays all clips in the selected folder.
   * Metadata columns:

     * Filename (cleaned/standardized, commas replaced with semicolons)
     * Duration 
     * Character
     * ID
     * Season (parsed from ID)
     * Episode (parsed from ID)
     * Clip order (parsed from ID)
     * Thumbnail preview 
   * Sort by:

     * ID
     * Character
     * Season and Episode
     * Clip order
   * Search / filter functionality by:

     * Filename / ID / Character
     * Season / Episode

3. Clip Preview Window

   * Plays selected clip within the tab.
   * Basic controls: play, pause, scrub.
   * Optional: show waveform if audio is present.

4. Drag & Drop Functionality

   * Drag clips from the list into timeline tab (future).
   * Preview drop order before sending to timeline.

5. Context Menu / Clip Actions

   * Right-click on clip:

     * Rename
     * Delete / move
     * View metadata
     * Preview

6. UI / UX Considerations

   * Clean, minimal design.
   * Smooth scrolling for large clip libraries.
   * Responsive layout (resizable panels).
   * Tabs clearly labeled; active tab highlighted.

Backend / Data Management:

* Internal data structure (JSON, pandas dataframe, or in-memory dict) storing:

  * Clip paths
  * Clip metadata (id, character, filename, season, episode, clip order)
  * Current sort/filter state
* Auto-update when new clips are added to the folder.

Optional / Later Features:

Multi-select clips

Describe a scene and get recommended clips
